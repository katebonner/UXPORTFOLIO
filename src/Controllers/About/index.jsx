            As an engineer and a designer, I see beauty in the dance between
            form and function, and my passion lies in creating digital solutions
            where every pixel, every line of code contributes to a product of
            fractal quality â€” a product where each detail, no matter how minute,
            echoes the cohesive harmony and thoughtful design of the whole.

            My bachelor's degree in physics provided me with an education that
            encompasses the mathematical disciplines of multivariable calculus,
            linear algebra, and differential equations. I've leveraged
            programming languages such as C++ and Python to analyze complex data
            sets and perform intricate simulations. My studies in advanced
            physical theories like quantum mechanics and space-time relativity
            fostered my scientific skepticism.

            My master's degree in design and technology provided me with an
            education at the nexus of design principles and emerging
            technologies. I've acquired skills in 3D Modeling, Animation,
            Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).

            My Full Stack Web Development bootcamp provided me with an education
            in both frontend and backend web technologies, from crafting
            engaging user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to managing
            servers and databases with Node.js, Express.js, SQL, noSQL and
            MongoDB.

            As a Front-end Mobile App Developer for a fast-paced, seed-stage
            fintech startup, I liaised between engineering and design teams,
            ensuring the viability and implementation of design systems and UI
            animations. I worked in TypeScript and React Native.
